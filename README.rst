Records: SQL for Humans‚Ñ¢
========================

Records is a very simple, but powerful, library for making raw SQL queries
to Postgres databases.

This common task can be surprisingly difficult with the standard tools available.
This library strives to make this workflow as simple as possible,
while providing an elegant interface to work with your query results.

We know how to write SQL, so let's send some to our database:

.. code:: python

    import records

    db = records.Database('postgres://...')
    rows = db.query('select * from active_users')    # or db.query_file('sqls/active-users.sql')

‚ò§ The Basics
------------

Grab one row at a time:

.. code:: python

    >>> rows[0]
    Record(username='model-t', name='Henry Ford', active=True, timezone=datetime.datetime(2016, 2, 6, 22, 28, 23, 894202), user_email='model-t@gmail.com')

Or iterate over them:

.. code:: python

    for r in rows:
        spam_user(name=r.name, email=r.user_email)

Or store them all for later reference:

.. code:: python

    >>> rows.all()
    [Record(username=...), Record(username=...), Record(username=...), ...]

‚ò§ Features
----------

- HSTORE support, if available.
- Iterated rows are cached for future reference.
- ``$DATABASE_URL`` environment variable support.
- Convenience ``Database.get_table_names`` method.
- Command-line `records` tool for exporting queries. 
- Safe `parameterization <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html>`_: ``Database.query('life=%s', params=('42',))``
- Queries can be passed as strings or filenames, parameters supported.
- Query results are iterators of standard Python dictionaries: ``{'column-name': 'value'}``

Records is proudly powered by `Psycopg2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2>`_
and `Tablib <http://docs.python-tablib.org/en/latest/>`_.

‚ò§ Data Export Functionality
---------------------------

Records also features full Tablib integration, and allows you to export
your results to CSV, XLS, JSON, HTML Tables, or YAML with a single line of code.
Excellent for sharing data with friends, or generating reports.

.. code:: pycon

    >>> print rows.dataset
    username|active|name      |user_email       |timezone
    --------|------|----------|-----------------|--------------------------
    model-t |True  |Henry Ford|model-t@gmail.com|2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202
    ...

- Comma Seperated Values (CSV)

  .. code:: pycon

      >>> print rows.export('csv')
      username,active,name,user_email,timezone
      model-t,True,Henry Ford,model-t@gmail.com,2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202
      ...

- YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)

  .. code:: python

      >>> print rows.export('yaml')
      - {active: true, name: Henry Ford, timezone: '2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202', user_email: model-t@gmail.com, username: model-t}
      ...

- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

  .. code:: python

      >>> print rows.export('json')
      [{"username": "model-t", "active": true, "name": "Henry Ford", "user_email": "model-t@gmail.com", "timezone": "2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202"}, ...]

- Microsoft Excel (xls, xlsx)

  .. code:: python

      with open('report.xls', 'wb') as f:
          f.write(rows.export('xls'))

You get the point. All other features of Tablib are also available,
so you can sort results, add/remove columns/rows, remove duplicates,
transpose the table, add separators, slice data by column, and more.

See the `Tablib Documentation <http://docs.python-tablib.org/en/latest/>`_
for more details.

‚ò§ Installation
--------------

Of course, the recommended installation method is pip::

    $ pip install records

‚ò§ Command-Line Tool
-------------------

As an added bonus, a ``records`` command-line tool is automaticlaly
included. Here's the usage information::

    Records: SQL for Humans‚Ñ¢
    A Kenneth Reitz project.

    Usage:
      records <query> <format> [-i] [--params <params>...] [--url=<url>]
      records (-h | --help)

    Options:
      -h --help         Show this screen.
      --url=<url>       The database URL to use. Defaults to $DATABASE_URL.
      --params          Prameterized query. Subsequent arguments are treated as
                        parameters to the query.
      -i --interactive  An interactive interpreter.

    Supported Formats:
       csv, tsv, json, yaml, html, xls, xlsx, dbf, latex, ods

   Note: xls, xlsx, dbf, and ods formats are binary, and should only be
         used with redirected output e.g. '$ records sql xls > sql.xls'.

    Notes:
      - While you may specify a Postgres connection string with --url, records
        will automatically default to the value of $DATABASE_URL, if available.
      - Query is intended to be the path of a SQL file, however a query string
        can be provided instead. Use this feature discernfully; it's dangerous.
      - Records is intended for report-style exports of database queries, and
        has not yet been optimized for extremely large data dumps.
      - Interactive mode is experimental and may be removed at any time.
        Feedback, as always, is much appreciated!  --me@kennethreitz.org

‚ò§ Thank You
-----------

Thanks for checking this library out! I hope you find it useful.

Of course, there's always room for improvement. Feel free to `open an issue <https://github.com/kennethreitz/records/issues>`_ so we can make Records better, stronger, faster.
